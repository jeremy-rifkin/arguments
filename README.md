This is a proof of concept / reference implementation for `std::arguments`, [P3474](https://wg21.link/P3474).

There may be minor bugs; this implementation is by no means perfect or production-ready. Its purpose is to demonstrate
implementability and provide a feel for the interface.

To build: `make build`
